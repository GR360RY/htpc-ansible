# Installation

## Prerequisites

Machine designated for an HTPC with Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop installed

## Quick installation

Open terminal and run one of the following commands:

Install HTPC Server with Bittorent Downloader ( Deluge )
```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/GR360RY/htpc-ansible/master/scripts/htpc-server-torrents.sh`"
```

Install HTPC Server with Usenet Downloader ( Sabnzbd )
```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/GR360RY/htpc-ansible/master/scripts/htpc-server-usenet.sh`"
```
Install HTPC Server with both Bittorent and Usenet Downloaders
```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/GR360RY/htpc-ansible/master/scripts/htpc-server.sh`"
```

## Customizing the setup
To customize the setup - edit xbmc-client-server.yml

# Default configuration settings
Sabnzbd if installed, will run on port 9000 to avoid conflit with XBMC.
All other packages are configured with their default ports and settings, unless xbmc-client-server.yml has been modified.

# Development and testing

## Prerequisites

### Install Vagrant
If you want to test out the configuration in VirtualMachine, or contribute to htpc-ansible development,
download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.10-93012.vbox-extpack)

### Install snapshot plugin for Vagrant
We will use a [vagrant-multiprovider-snap](https://github.com/scalefactory/vagrant-multiprovider-snap) to roll machine back instead of recreating box from scratch.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-multiprovider-snap
```
## Deployment

### Bringing up the machine

#### Bring up ubuntu desktop only
```
vagrant up --no-provision
```
#### Snapshot the machine.

```
vagrant snap take
```

### Deploying htpc-ansible
```
vagrant provision
```

### Reverting snapshot
In case you want to redeploy from scratch - simply revert the snapshot back to the machine with desktop installed.
```
vagrant snap rollback
```

### Testing and configuring WEB services
Vagrant box creates private network, with xbmc server available at <b>172.30.30.30</b>.
All the web services can be tested and configured through this address.
