# Installation

## Prerequisites

1. Machine designated for an HTPC with Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop installed
2. htpc-ansible playbook requires [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) installed on a machine, from which deployment is run. Installation instructions are [here](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)

## Quick installation

### From an HTPC itself
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/GR360RY/htpc-ansible
cd htpc-ansible
echo -e  "[xbmc-server]\n127.0.0.1" >! hosts
ansible-playbook -i hosts -K xbmc-client-server.yml --connection=local
```

### From another machine

This requires SSH daemon to be up on HTPC machine. Installation can be performed with regular user (sudo password will be required) or root.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GR360RY/htpc-ansible
cd htpc-ansible
ADDR=___HTPC_ADDR_OR_HOSTNAME___ echo "[xbmc-server]\n${ADDR}" > hosts
ansible-playbook -i hosts -K --user ___USERNAME___ --ask-pass xbmc-client-server.yml
```

## Customizing the setup
To customize the setup - edit xbmc-client-server.yml

# Default configuration settings
All packages are configured with their default ports and settings, unless xbmc-client-server.yml has been modified.

# Development and testing

## Prerequisites

### Install Vagrant
If you want to test out the configuration in VirtualMachine, or contribute to htpc-ansible development,
download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.10-93012.vbox-extpack)

### Install snapshot plugin for Vagrant
We will use a [vagrant-multiprovider-snap](https://github.com/scalefactory/vagrant-multiprovider-snap) to roll machine back instead of recreating box from scratch.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-multiprovider-snap
```
## Deployment

### Bringing up the machine

#### Bring up ubuntu desktop only
```
vagrant up --no-provision
```
#### Snapshot the machine.

```
vagrant snap take
```

### Deploying htpc-ansible
```
vagrant provision
```

### Reverting snapshot
In case you want to redeploy from scratch - simply revert the snapshot back to the machine with desktop installed.
```
vagrant snap rollback
```

### Testing and configuring WEB services
Vagrant box creates private network, with xbmc server available at <b>172.30.30.30</b>.
All the web services can be tested and configured through this address.
