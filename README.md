## Development and Testing

### Prerequisites

#### Install Vagrant
If you want to test out the configuration in VirtualMachine, or contribute to htpc-ansible development,
download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.10-93012.vbox-extpack)

#### Install snapshot plugin for Vagrant
We will use a [vagrant-multiprovider-snap](https://github.com/scalefactory/vagrant-multiprovider-snap) to roll machine back instead of recreating box from scratch.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-multiprovider-snap
```
### Deployment

#### Bringing up the machine

##### Bring up ubuntu desktop only
```
vagrant up --no-provision
```
##### Snapshot the machine.

```
vagrant snap take
```

#### Deploying htpc-ansible
```
vagrant provision
```

#### Reverting snapshot
In case you want to redeploy from scratch - simply revert the snapshot back to the machine with desktop installed.
```
vagrant snap rollback
```

#### Testing and configuring WEB services
Vagrant box creates private network, with xbmc server available at <b>172.30.30.30</b>.
All the web services can be tested and configured through this address.
