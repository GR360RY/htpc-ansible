## Development and Testing with Vagrant

### Prerequisites

#### Install Vagrant
If you want to test out the configuration in VirtualMachine or contribute to htpc-ansible development,
download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

#### Install snapshot plugin for Vagrant
We will use a [vagrant-multiprovider-snap](https://github.com/scalefactory/vagrant-multiprovider-snap) to roll machine back instead of recreating box from scratch.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-multiprovider-snap
```
### Deployment

#### Bringing up the machine

##### Bring up ubuntu desktop only
```
vagrant up --no-provision
```
##### Snapshot the machine.

```
vagrant snap take
```

#### Deploying htpc-ansible
```
vagrant provision
```

#### Reverting snapshot
In case you want to redeploy from scratch - simply revert the snapshot back to the machine with desktop installed.
```
vagrant snap rollback
```

#### Testing and configuring WEB services
Vagrant box is configured to have bridged eth1 interface.
All the web services can be tested and configured through [http://htpc-vm/](http://htpc-vm/)
